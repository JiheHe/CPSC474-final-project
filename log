Interesting observation:
If we don't switch non-dealer (starter) position, then the starter has 60% win rate in random vs. random scenario, signaling that
it is a favored position under the current rule. With the alternating implemented, the dealers have even win rates. The setup is now fair.

Also confirmed that the game works as intended. None of the errors are raised, signaling proper agent implementations following the game
rules. Also did some print statements to inspect the output to follow through some games; all seem to make sense logically.
